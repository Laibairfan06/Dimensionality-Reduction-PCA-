# Dimensionality-Reduction-PCA-
This repository contains code for performing dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in combination with logistic regression. PCA is utilized to reduce the number of features in the dataset while retaining the most important information. The logistic regression model is then trained on the transformed dataset to perform classification tasks. The code includes implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction, training of logistic regression models, and evaluation of model performance. This repository serves as a practical demonstration of how PCA can be effectively integrated with logistic regression for efficient feature engineering and classification in machine learning projects.
